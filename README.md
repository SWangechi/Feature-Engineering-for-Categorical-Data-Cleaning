Feature Engineering for Categorical Data Cleaning
1. Dataset Acquisition:
   - Find and download a dataset that contains significant categorical data from any reliable source other than Kaggle. If you already have a dataset with substantial categorical features, you may use that instead.
   - Your chosen dataset must meet the following criteria:
     - At least **8 categorical columns**
     - A minimum of **10,000 rows**
   - Ensure that the dataset is relevant to a topic of interest and provides a variety of categorical features for analysis.

2. Feature Engineering Techniques:
   Apply the following feature engineering techniques to clean and enhance the categorical data in your dataset:

   - Handling Missing Values:
     - Discuss the strategies you will use to address missing values in categorical features (e.g., imputation, removal, or replacement).
     - Implement the selected strategy and document the reasoning behind your choices, including any assumptions made.

   - Encoding Categorical Variables:
     - Choose appropriate methods for encoding categorical variables. Options include one-hot encoding, label encoding, ordinal encoding, and others based on the nature of the data.
     - Apply the chosen encoding method(s) to the dataset and provide a clear explanation for your selections, including the advantages and limitations of each method in your context.

   - Reducing Cardinality:
     - Identify categorical features with high cardinality and explore techniques to reduce it (e.g., grouping rare categories, feature binning, or combining similar categories).
     - Implement these techniques and justify your approach, discussing how it impacts the dataset's interpretability and performance in analysis.

   - Creating New Features:
     - Investigate the possibility of creating new features from existing categorical data (e.g., combining categories, extracting components, or generating interaction terms).
     - Create at least one new feature and explain its potential impact on future analysis or modelling, including how it may enhance predictive power or insights.

3. Documentation:
   - Document the process, findings, and rationale for each step taken in feature engineering. Include:
     - Code snippets that illustrate your implementation
     - Visualizations that support your analysis (e.g., distribution plots, bar charts for categorical data)
     - Summaries of key findings and decisions made throughout the process.
   - Prepare a comprehensive report or Jupyter Notebook (or a preferred format) that encompasses the exploration, feature cleaning, and engineering process.

4. Submission:
   - Submit your cleaned dataset along with the report or notebook detailing your approach and results.
   - Ensure your submission includes a brief conclusion discussing the impact of your feature engineering efforts on data quality and potential analysis. Highlight any insights gained and how the dataset is now better suited for analysis or modelling.
